Addon to help with wardrobe organization. Load the addon with `/addon load springcleaning` and run it by typing `/springcleaning`.

Reads the contents of your wardrobe and searches for each item in all Ashitacast profiles that match your character name (e.g. if your character's name is Figaro, it will match Figaro_SMN.xml, Figaro_BLM.xml, Figaro_NIN.xml, etc.). It will then print a line to the chatlog indicating that "<item> in <wardrobe> is not referenced by Ashitacast" so you can see what items might be better moved to another storage container.
